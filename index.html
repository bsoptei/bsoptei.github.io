      <h3>Function composition in Rust using a custom smart pointer</h3>
      <p>Still drunk with the power of <a class="link" href="http://bsoptei.github.io#functional_hello_r">function composition</a>, I started to play around with the technique in <a class="link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, a language I've been experimenting with. <a class="link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is a low-level language with a strict compiler that saves you from doing dangerous things. Furthermore, <a class="link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is a functional language. It has several concepts and features inspired by Haskell (<a class="link" href="https://science.raphael.poss.name/rust-for-functional-programmers.html">read more</a>) and Scala for example. The design of <a class="link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> makes it highly expressive and attractive.</p>
      <p>I have found some intro posts on the functional nature of Rust, such as, <a class="link" href="http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/functional-programming-in-rust-part-1">this</a>, and <a class="link" href="http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/functional-programming-in-rust-part-2/">this</a>. I also recommend <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">the Rust book</a>. To reproduce what’s happening here, first you will need a recent version of stable Rust. I’m using Rust version 1.29.0 here. Then clone the repo <a class="link" href="https://github.com/bsoptei/fbox_example">fbox_example</a>, compile &amp; run the program on your local machine. In this post, I am going to show (sometimes simplified) snippets of the code.</p>
      <p>If you want to <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch19-05-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#returning-closures">return a function</a> in Rust, you can do it if you wrap it in a <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch15-01-box.html">Box</a>, for example. <strong>Box</strong> is a smart pointer in Rust, it allows you to store data on the heap. In order to have composable functions that allow a user friendly syntax, I have decided to define a custom type, a smart pointer called <strong>FBox</strong>.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="green">pub struct</span> <span class="blue">FBox</span>&lt;FIn, FOut&gt; {</p>
        <p>&emsp;<span class="blue">f</span>: <strong>Box</strong>&lt;Fn(FIn) <span class="red">-></span> FOut&gt;</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>FBox</strong> has a function <span class="blue">f</span>. The <i>generic</i> type parameters <strong>FIn</strong> and <strong>FOut</strong> represent the input and output type of <span class="blue">f</span>. The type signature of <span class="blue">f</span> shows tat <span class="blue">f</span> can be any kind of function that <strong>a)</strong> has one argument; and <strong>b)</strong> <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">takes <i>ownership</i></a> of the argument. The handling of values is governed by the <i>ownership</i> rules of Rust, and <i>safety</i> is guaranteed by the compiler.</p>
      <p>The <i>behavior</i> of FBox is defined by its <i>methods</i>. Its factory method <strong>FBox</strong>::<span class="blue">new</span> takes a function as argument and wraps it in an <strong>FBox</strong>.</p>
      <p>But before going any further with the <strong>FBox</strong>'s behavior, let's see what I'm going to use it for. The Rust book has a really cool <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html">example of an http server</a>. One of its features is that it reads html files from the file system and converts them into collections of bytes (<span class="green">u8</span>, unsigned 8-bit integer) before writing them to the stream. I'm going to create similar functionality here using the <span class="blue">and_then</span> method of <strong>FBox</strong>. Read a file based on a path, and return the contents as an <i>immutable</i> collection of bytes.</p>
      <p>I need building blocks first. I import a function from the standard library as <span class="blue">read_from_path</span>. It will read a file and return a <strong>Vec</strong> of bytes wrapped in a <strong>Result</strong>. Then I want to safely unwrap the result of the file IO via <span class="blue">extract_bytes</span>.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="green">fn</span> <span class="blue">extract_bytes</span>(bytes_in_a_result: <span class="magenta">Res</span>) <span class="red">-&gt;</span> <strong>Vec</strong>&lt;<span class="green">u8</span>&gt; {</p>
        <p>&emsp;bytes_in_a_result.<span class="blue">unwrap_or_else</span>(|error| { <u>println!</u>("<span class="green">{:?}"</span>, error); <u>vec!</u>[] })</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </div>
      <p>Here, <span class="magenta">Res</span> is a <a class="link" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch19-04-advanced-types.html#creating-type-synonyms-with-type-aliases"><i>type alias</i></a> for the <strong>Result</strong>&lt;_, _&gt; type (<a class="link" href="https://github.com/bsoptei/fbox_example">check the repo</a> to see what it actually stands for). The <span class="blue">unwrap_or_else</span> method of the <strong>Result</strong> type is <i>lazy</i>, it will only print the error and create an empty <strong>Vec</strong> if it actually finds an error, otherwise it returns the file contents.</p>
      <p>Then I want to convert the the collection to immutable, such as <strong>Vector</strong> from the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/bodil/im-rs">immutable Rust collection library <i>im</i><a>, because I prefer immutability and <strong>Vec</strong> of the standard library is mutable. So, the third building block is <strong>Vector</strong>::<span class="blue">from</span>.</p>
      <p>Now I can call <strong>FBox</strong>::<span class="blue">new</span> with <span class="blue">read_from_path</span> as argument, and use the <span class="blue">and_then</span> method to create a composite function. What <span class="blue">and_then</span> does is that it takes the <span class="blue">f</span> from <strong>FBox</strong> and an argument <i>g</i>, and returns</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><strong>FBox</strong>::<span class="blue">new</span>(<span class="green">move</span> |x| g((<span class="green">self</span>.f)(x)))</p>
      </div>
      <p>You wrap a function g(f(x)) in an <strong>FBox</strong>. The <span class="green">move</span> keyword here is to</p>
      <div class="block docs">
        <p>make a closure take <i>ownership</i> of all its captures</p>
      </div>
      <p>The other method <span class="blue">compose</span> gives you f(g(x)):</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><strong>FBox</strong>::<span class="blue">new</span>(<span class="green">move</span> FBox::new(move |x| (self.f)(g(x)))
      </div>
      <p>I prefer <span class="blue">and_then</span> over  <span class="blue">compose</span> because to me it's easier to read and to reason about (it is called 'and then' for a reason).</p>
      <p>When using <span class="blue">and_then</span>, the input type of <i>g</i> must match the output type of <span class="blue">f</span>. If there is any mismatch, the compiler will throw an error. Which means the composition is <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety"><i>type safe</i></a>.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="green">let</span> <span class="blue">bytes_from_path</span> <span class="red">=</span></p>
        <p>&emsp;<strong>FBox</strong>::<span class="blue">new</span>(read_from_path)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;.<span class="blue">and_then</span>(extract_bytes)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;.<span class="blue">and_then</span>(<strong>Vector</strong>::from);</p>
      </div>
      <p>This definition tells you what you can expect if you call <span class="blue">bytes_from_path</span>. It reads a file from the path, then extracts the bytes from the result, then creates an immutable <strong>Vector</strong> of bytes. Nothing happened yet though because <strong>FBox</strong> is <i>lazy</i>. You need to tell it explicitly to apply its function by calling the <span class="blue">apply</span> method.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="green">let</span> <span class="blue">bytes</span> <span class="red">=</span> bytes_from_path.<span class="blue">apply</span>(path);</p>
      </div>
      <p>To see the results, let's use <u>println!</u>.</p>
      <div class="block code">
      <p><u>println!</u>(<span class="green">"{:?}"</span>, bytes);</p>
      </div>
      <p>When using the path of the example file <a class="link" href="https://github.com/bsoptei/fbox_example">index.html</a>, you get something like this:</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>[60, 33, 68, 79, 67, 84, 89, 80, 69 <span class="grey">// Rest is omitted</span></p>
      </div>
      <p>Wrapping it up, I have defined a smart pointer <strong>FBox</strong>. <strong>FBox</strong> has a function, and allows you to use functions as building blocks via methods <span class="blue">compose</span> and <span class="blue">and_then</span>. The compiler guarantees the <i>type safety</i> of composition, and safe memory management by the <i>ownership</i> rules of Rust. <strong>FBox</strong> is <i>lazy</i>, it only applies its function when you explicitly tell it to do so by calling the <span class="blue">apply</span> method with an input value. You can use functions from different libraries, and easily define your own. And with only a few lines of readable and simple code, you can create heavy machinery.</p>

      <h3 id="functional_hello_r">A functional hello to R</h3>
      <p>I study R because I am looking for an effective data analysis tool. I am a post-hello-world R student interested in functional programming (FP). You might have heard about, or learning, or already mastered FP. If you are interested in a brief summary on the concept, you can find one <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@emadalam/fp-rp-frp-what-the-f-71c4949c29d" >here</a> or <a class="link" href="https://snipcart.com/blog/functional-programming-paradigm-concepts" >here</a> for example, or take a look at the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" >Wikipedia article on FP</a>. My motivation here is that I prefer data analysis <i>without changing the data</i>. Furthermore, if one is familiar with FP, and the language one is learning supports FP, the way of <i>calculating things</i> can be very easy to find. Especially when learning a high-level language with a lightweight syntax.</p>
      <p>If you want to reproduce what's happening in this post, you can do it using the <a class="link" href="https://www.r-project.org/" >R interpreter</a>. My current R version is 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- "Feather Spray". If you want to have answers about a function immediately, use the interpreter. Simply type '?' and the name of the function. As an example, you can do it like this for the <i>sum</i> function:</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; ?sum</p>
      </div>
      <p>It opens the corresponding page for <i>sum</i> in your browser. As an alternative, you can take a look at the <a class="link" href="https://www.r-project.org/" >R documentation.</a></p></p>
      <p>So if you're ready, let's go!</p>
      <p>Let's define a function first! In R, you can use the <span class="green">function</span> keyword to do that.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">sq</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> <span class="green">function</span>(n) n ^ 2</p>
      </div>
      <p>The '<span class="magenta">&lt;-</span>' is an assignment operator in R. So I have created a function and I call it <span class="blue">sq</span>.</p>
      <p>But what does it do? The R interpreter will tell us.</p>
      <p>First, I create a vector of numbers in the range of 1 to 10.</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; one.to.ten &lt;- 1:10; one.to.ten</p>
        <p>[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10</p>
      </div>
      <p>Which I pass directly to  <span class="blue">sq</span>.</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; sq(one.to.ten)</p>
        <p>[1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100</p>
      </div>
      <p>Wow! What happened here?</p>
      <div class="block console">
      <p>&gt; ?'^'</p>
      </div>
      <p>The Description of Arithmetic Operators looks like this:</p>
      <div class="block docs">
        <p>These unary and binary operators perform arithmetic on numeric or complex <strong>vectors</strong> (or objects which can be coerced to them)</p>
      </div>
      <p>You can try the operator directly:</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; one.to.ten ^ 2</p>
        <p>[1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100</p>
      </div>
      <p>You can even do</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; one.to.ten ^ one.to.ten</p>
        <p>[1]           1           4          27         256        3125       46656</p>
        <p>[7]      823543    16777216   387420489 10000000000</p>
      </div>
      <p>Which is doing something like [1 ^ 1, 2 ^2 ... 10 ^ 10.]</p>
      <p>This is a consequence of the functional and array language nature of R. It's like an undercover <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)" >map</a> (<a class="link" href="https://hackernoon.com/map-filter-and-reduce-67d408e06107" >about map, filter, and reduce</a>) function.</p>
      <p>You can use other operators such as '&lt;' to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(higher-order_function)" >filter</a> your data using the square bracket notation.</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; one.to.ten[one.to.ten &lt; 2]</p>
        <p>[1] 1</p>
      </div>
      <p>As you can see, R supports <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" >higher-order functions</a> (HOFs). You can do mapping, filtering, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)" >aggregation</a> (R has built-in functions <i>Map</i>, <i>Filter</i>, and <i>Reduce</i>), and even more.</p>
      <p> Now, I'm going to define a sum of squares function (by which I mean &Sigma;<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> here). I have the building blocks, R's <i>sum</i>, and my very own <span class="blue">sq</span> so I don't have to do it from scratch. I only need to use <i>sum</i> and <span class="blue">sq</span> to build larger blocks via <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)" >function composition</a>.</p>
      <p>I came across an R library called <a class="link" href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/" >purrr</a>, which - among other awesome FP tools - has a function called <i>compose</i> for this purpose. I'm going to use one of <strong>purrr</strong>'s features in this post, but first I'm going to show you how you can define your own compose function in R.</p>
      <p>Based on the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)" >definition</a>, you can do it like this:</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">my.compose</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> <span class="green">function</span>(f, g) <span class="green">function</span>(x) f(g(x))</p>
      </div>
      <p>I have defined a higher-order function <span class="blue">my.compose</span>. It takes two functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> as arguments, and returns a function, which applies <i>g</i> to a given argument, then applies <i>f</i> to the output of <i>g</i>.</p>
      <p>I can define my sum of squares writing</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">sum.of.squares</span> <span class="magenta"><-</span> my.compose(sum, sq)</p>
      </div>
      <p>Let's say you have a vector of numbers. When you pass it to <span class="blue">sum.of.squares</span>, first the squares are calculated for all numbers in the vector, then aggregated by <i>sum</i>.</p>
      <p>Let's check how it works for the test input!</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; sum.of.squares(one.to.ten)</p>
        <p>[1] 385</p>
      </div>
      <p>I can think of another example. Let's say I have some data with outliers.</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; data.with.outliers &lt;- c(1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9)</p>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <p>I'd like to calculate the mean and variance, but I want to filter the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier" >outliers</a> first. There is a <a class="link" href="http://r-statistics.co/Outlier-Treatment-With-R.html" >post</a>  on outlier handling by the way if you want to dig deeper. Here, I'm going to use a solution found on StackOverflow.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">filter.outliers</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> <span class="green">function</span>(x) x[!x %in% boxplot.stats(x)$out]</p>
      </div>
      <p>It works like this:</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; filter.outliers(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 4 5 4 5 4 5</p>
      </div>
      <p>I can define equivalent functions of <i>mean</i> and <i>var</i>, with automatic outlier filtering.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">mean.wo</span> <span class="magenta"><-</span> my.compose(mean, filter.outliers)</p>
        <p><span class="blue">var.wo</span> <span class="magenta"><-</span> my.compose(var, filter.outliers)</p>
      </div>
      <p>The 'wo' in the name stands for without outliers.</p>
      <p>You can check how it affects the mean and variance:</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; mean(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 4.625</p>
        <p>&gt; mean.wo(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 4.5</p>
        <p>&gt; var(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 4.839286</p>
        <p>&gt; var.wo(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 0.3</p>
      </div>
      <p>If you want to try your own outlier handling, you can do it by function composition.</p>
      <p>There's another FP feature I'd like to show, namely <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application" >partial application</a>. I'm going to need <strong>purrr</strong> for this.</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; library(purrr)</p>
      </div>
      <p>I am going to tell <span class="blue">my.compose</span> to always apply <span class="blue">filter.outliers</span> as its <i>g</i> argument. It will behave like a "function factory". It is going to create functions that automatically filter outliers of a vector, and apply another function of choice to the vector.</p>
      <div class="block code">
         <p><span class="blue">filter.then</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> partial(my.compose, g=filter.outliers)</p>
      </div>
      <p>Now I can define my sum (and sum of squares) without outliers.</p>
      <div class="block code">
        <p><span class="blue">sum.wo</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> filter.then(sum)</p>
        <p><span class="blue">sum.of.squares.wo</span> <span class="magenta">&lt;-</span> filter.then(sum.of.squares)</p>
      </div>
      <p>So let's try the above in the interpreter!</p>
      <div class="block console">
        <p>&gt; sum(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 37</p>
        <p>&gt; sum.wo(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 27</p>
        <p>&gt; sum.of.squares(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 205</p>
        <p>&gt; sum.of.squares.wo(data.with.outliers)</p>
        <p>[1] 123</p>
      </div>
      <p>The differences you see between the 'wo' and non-'wo' numbers mean that the automatic outlier filtering works! On top of that, the functions <span class="blue">sum.wo</span> and <span class="blue">sum.of.squares.wo</span> can be further composed if needed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Doing this exercise made me experience the advantages of <i>FP in R.</i> Using R in a functional style can help me build powerful tools quite fast, and keep my code concise. Using my new tools, I can analyze data without changing the data.</p>
      <p>R and functional programming are friends, so R and I are going to be friends. So hello R!</p>
